The Lewis Bolt was used by the Romans to lift heavy masonry. It sits within a dovetail-shaped recess chiseled into
the stone and is inserted in two parts. First, the outer pegs are inserted and then a third peg is hammered between them,
causing all three parts to match the shape of the recess. The stone can then be lifted by a shackle that is attached
to the pegs via a bolt slid through a hole in the top of each peg.

This is an interesting device I learned about in [Brunelleschi's Dome by Ross King](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6050499-brunelleschi-s-dome) (page 63). The 
book suggests that the device was originally used by the Romans, and then rediscovered centuries later by [Filippo Brunelleschi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi) 
after he observed recesses in the stones of Roman architecture.
