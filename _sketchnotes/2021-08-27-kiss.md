![Description of the KISS principle surrounded by a Rube Goldberg inspired machine](/assets/images/sketchnotes/2021-08-27-kiss/kiss.jpg)

The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle stresses the importance of making a conscious effort to simplify wherever possible, since the less complexity a project has the easier it is to understand, debug, and the less that can go wrong.

This principle has been around for a very long time and is applicable to most other disciplines, however it has a particular relevance to software development where developers can all too easily create complicated [balls of mud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud).
