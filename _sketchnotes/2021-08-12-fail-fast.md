Failing fast is when you design your application to handle failures as soon as they're encountered, rather than continuing a possibly erroneous process.

Failures may be deliberately tolerated (known as a fault-tolerant system), halt the process or report instantly to the user through a UI, however in any case enough information is captured at the point of the failure to aid debugging.
